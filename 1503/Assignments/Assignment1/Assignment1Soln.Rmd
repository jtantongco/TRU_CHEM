###1.  
In two or three lines, distinguish between the following pairs of terms. 
Give examples where appropriate.

a. 
A SI base unit is measurable quality is fundamentally different from properties.
Ex. Celsius for temperature, and meters for length
A SI derived unit is measurable quality is either dimensionless or a unit made through some combination of base units
Ex. speed in meters per second, frequency in hertz

b. 
The atomic number is the # of protons present in the nucleus of the atom.
Atomic weight is roughly the # protons and neutrons. It is standardized to Carbon element.

c. # Assume Arrehnius acid is meant
Acids are substances that create excess hydronium ions ($H _3 O^+$).
Substances are substances that create excess hydroxide ions ($OH^-$).

d.
Precision is the degree of exactness a measureant has.
Roughly, this is correlated with the number of significant digits attached to measurement.
Accuracy is the degree of correctness a measurement has.

Ex. 
If x = 25, then: 
x=25.00000000 is both accurate and precise
x=1.555555555 is precise but not accurate
x=24.5 is accurate but not precise 

###2.  

Part A.  
i. Arsenic (III) Trisulphide  
ii. Aluminum dichromate  
iii. Manganese (II) Bromite  
iv. Nitrous oxide (Dinitrogen monoxide)  
v. Titanium (IV) Carbonate  
vi. Phosphorous Triiodide  
vii. Nickel (II) hydrogen carbonate  
viii. Copper (III) Suplhate  

Part B.  
i. $Cl_2 O_5$  
ii. $Co(MnO_4)_2$  
iii. $Ca(OH)_2$  
iv. $SO_3$  
v. $Cr(C_2H_3O_2)_3$  
vi. $IO_7$  
vii. $HNO_2$  
viii. $Pb_3N_2$  

###3.
``` {r defn}
mole <- 6.022e23
atomicWeight <- 3.04e8
density <- 1.10 #g/cm^3
volumeDNAmolecule <- atomicWeight * mole^-1 * (density)^-1
```
The volume of a DNA molecule is `r format(volumeDNAmolecule, digits =3)`$cm^3$

###4.
```{r Q4}
percentC <- 49.02
percentH <- 2.743
percentCl <- 48.24
listPercent <- c(percentC,percentH,percentCl)
listWeight <- c(12,1,35.5)
listMols <- listPercent / listWeight
empiricalFormula <- listMols / min(listMols)
```

a.
The empirical formula is C$_`r round(empiricalFormula[1])`$ H$_`r round(empiricalFormula[2])`$ Cl$_`r round(empiricalFormula[3])`$

b.
``` {r Q4b}
EmpiricalWeight <- listWeight %*% empiricalFormula
ActualMolarWeight <- 147.0 #g/mol
MolecularFormulaCoeff <- ActualMolarWeight/EmpiricalWeight
MolecularFormula <- MolecularFormulaCoeff*empiricalFormula
```

The empirical formula is C$_`r round(MolecularFormula[1])`$ H$_`r round(MolecularFormula[2])`$ Cl$_`r round(MolecularFormula[3])`$

###5.
a. $PbS + 2 PbO -> 3 Pb_{(s)} + SO_2$   
b. $14.0g* \frac{1 mol}{223g} * \frac{3 mol Pb}{2 mol PbO}$ = `r format(14.0/223*3/2, digits=3)` mol $Pb_{(s)}$
c.  $14.0g* \frac{1 mol}{223g} * \frac{1 mol SO_2}{2 mol PbO} * \frac{64.1 g SO_2}{1 mol SO_2}$ = `r format(14.0/223*1/2*64.1, digits=3)` g $SO_2$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

The current date is `r format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
